The war began after several Southern states seceded from the Union, forming the Confederate States of America in response to the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860 and the growing tensions related to slavery.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1861, the conflict officially commenced with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina on April 12th. This led President Lincoln to call for 75,000 volunteers, sparking additional Southern states to secede. The key early battles included Bull Run and the Battle of Shiloh, indicating that the war would be longer and more brutal than initially anticipated.\\\\n\\\\nBy 1862, the war had expanded across multiple fronts. Key events include the introduction of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Lincoln, which declared all slaves in Confederate states to be free, turning the conflict more distinctly into a war about slavery as well as state rights. Major battles like Antietam, which remains one of the deadliest single-day battles in American history, further underscored the ferocity of the conflict.\\\\n\\\\nThe year 1863 is marked significantly by the Battle of Gettysburg and the Siege of Vicksburg. These were pivotal Union victories that significantly turned the tide of the war. The Gettysburg Address, delivered by Lincoln in November, redefined the purpose of the war and is one of the most famous speeches in American history.\\\\n\\\\nIn 1864-65, General Ulysses S. Grant led the Union forces in a series of battles that gradually crushed the Confederate resistance. Sherman's March to the Sea further devastated the South's infrastructure and economy. The war concluded with the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee to Grant at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The aftermath of the war involved Reconstruction, a period of rebuilding and integrating the Southern states back into the Union, marked by significant social, economic, and legislative changes.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 120,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 430,\n    \"total_tokens\": 550,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_eae715ec6a\"\n}\n"
