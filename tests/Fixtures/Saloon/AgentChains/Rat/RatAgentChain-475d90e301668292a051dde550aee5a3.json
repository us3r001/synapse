The war erupted after the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, leading to the secession of seven Southern slave states and the formation of the Confederate States of America. The conflict was precipitated by the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina on April 12, 1861, prompting President Lincoln to issue a call for troops, which led to more states joining the Confederacy.\\\\n\\\\nKey early battles included Bull Run and the Battle of Shiloh, demonstrating that the conflict would be neither quick nor easy. In 1862, the Emancipation Proclamation promised freedom to slaves in Confederate states, reframing the war as a struggle not just for union but also for human freedom. The Battle of Antietam, on September 17, 1862, marked one of the deadliest days in American military history and was significant not just militarily but for its political outcomes as well\u2014providing President Lincoln the momentum needed to issue the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. This decree, which promised to free slaves in rebel states, changed the trajectory of the war and solidified the moral grounds of the Union cause.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 7218,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 280,\n    \"total_tokens\": 7498,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_eae715ec6a\"\n}\n"
