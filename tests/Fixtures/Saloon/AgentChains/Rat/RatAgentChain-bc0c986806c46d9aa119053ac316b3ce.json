Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, disunion sentiments heightened, leading to the secession of several Southern states to form the Confederate States of America. The formal beginning of the war was marked by the Confederate bombardment of Fort Sumter on April 12, 1861, prompting Lincoln&#039;s call for troops and triggering further secessions.\\\\n\\\\n#### Turning Points and Key Battles\\\\nA crucial turning point in the conflict was the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863, one of the bloodiest battles over three days, which ended in a significant defeat for the Confederates. This battle was later commemorated by President Lincoln&#039;s Gettysburg Address, which underscored the war&#039;s purpose of preserving a nation dedicated to the principles of equality and democracy.\\\\n\\\\n#### Conclusion and Aftermath\\\\nIn the concluding years of the war, under the leadership of General Ulysses S. Grant, the Union forces launched decisive campaigns, leading eventually to the fall of key Southern cities and the surrender of General Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. The war officially concluded with further surrenders across the Confederate armies and marked a profound transformation in American society, leading into the period known as Reconstruction, aimed at re-integrating the seceded states and abolishing slavery.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 480,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 344,\n    \"total_tokens\": 824,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_eae715ec6a\"\n}\n"
