The eruption of war followed the 1860 election of Abraham Lincoln, leading to the secession of seven Southern slave-holding states and the establishment of the Confederate States of America. The war commenced with the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter in South Carolina on April 12, 1861, which prompted President Lincoln to call for troops, causing more states to join the Confederacy.\\\\n\\\\nAn early pivotal battle was the Battle of Gettysburg in 1863, which, occurring four months prior to Lincoln's famous Gettysburg Address, marked a turning point. The battle was one of the bloodiest, with over 45,000 men killed, injured, captured, or missing. Lincoln's Gettysburg Address, delivered at the dedication of a military cemetery there, has since been celebrated as a profound reminder of the war's higher purpose\u2014highlighting themes of human equality and the enduring value of democracy.\\\"\\n}\\n```\",\n        \"refusal\": null\n      },\n      \"logprobs\": null,\n      \"finish_reason\": \"stop\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"usage\": {\n    \"prompt_tokens\": 4604,\n    \"completion_tokens\": 238,\n    \"total_tokens\": 4842,\n    \"prompt_tokens_details\": {\n      \"cached_tokens\": 0\n    },\n    \"completion_tokens_details\": {\n      \"reasoning_tokens\": 0\n    }\n  },\n  \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_eae715ec6a\"\n}\n"
